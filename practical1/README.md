Input: 
Please input two positive integers and you will get to know whether numner is even or odd.



We can get to know about basics of c starting from the printf(syntax for printing output), where we print integer and float values.
And integrate those values in the sentence.
there is scanf fuction to scan the 2 numbers from user, which is used to take input from the user and that input can be used further in the code.
