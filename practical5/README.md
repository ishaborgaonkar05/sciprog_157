Practical05
This is the FIFth practical where we code and execute three programs. The first one is the code to understand scanf function. The other two are Fibonnaci series code and Inverse Hyperbolic Tanget function.

Compile:
1. Scanf function:
gcc -o scan use_scanf.c
Execute:
./scan

Enter an int and a double:
2
3.5678
You entered: 2 and 3.567800
2. Fibonacci:
gcc -o fibo fibo.c -lm
Execute:
./fibo

Please enter a positive intergern
9
This fib. series is:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
3. Hyperbolic arc tangent:
gcc -o arctan arctanh.c -lm
Execute:
./arctan

Please enter a positive real number delta: 
0.01
